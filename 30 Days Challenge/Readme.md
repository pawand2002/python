# 🐍 30 Days of Python Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **30 Days of Python Challenge**!  
I’m practicing daily in **Google Colab**, documenting all exercises, notes, and projects in **one consolidated notebook** for easy reference.  

The focus is not just on theory but also on **building real-world mini-projects** along the way.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Build a **solid foundation** in Python  
- Document everything in **one Google Colab notebook**  
- Apply concepts in **real-world case projects**  
- Share learnings & progress consistently  
- Become **interview-ready** with hands-on skills
